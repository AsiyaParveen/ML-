Got it! Here's a Week 2 description in the same style as your Week 1 write-up:

### **Internship Week 2 - Developers Hub**

Welcome to my Week 2 internship project at Developers Hub! This repository contains the work I completed during the second week, focusing on **Supervised Learning**, including both **Classification** and **Regression** tasks.

---

### **Overview**

During this week, I learned the fundamental concepts of supervised machine learning and applied them using real-world datasets. The focus was on understanding the complete ML workflowâ€”data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

Key topics covered:

* **Linear Regression** on the Boston Housing dataset
* **Logistic Regression** on the Titanic and Iris datasets
* Splitting data using `train_test_split`
* Model evaluation using `accuracy_score`, `mean_squared_error`, and confusion matrices

---

### **Mini Assignment**

As part of the hands-on exercise, I built a **classification model** to predict survival on the **Titanic dataset**. This included:

* Data preprocessing
* Model training and testing
* Confusion matrix and accuracy analysis
* Visualizations for performance evaluation

---

### **Technologies Used**

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
